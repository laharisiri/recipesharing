   <div><pre>Prepare the Marinade:

    In a bowl, combine the chopped onion, minced garlic, vegetable oil, vinegar, ground paprika, ground cumin, ground coriander, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create the marinade.
    Marinate the Meat:
    
    Place the meat cubes in a large resealable plastic bag or a bowl.
    Pour the marinade over the meat, making sure all the pieces are well coated. Seal the bag or cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
    Refrigerate and let the meat marinate for at least 2 hours, or ideally overnight. This allows the flavors to penetrate the meat.
    Skewer the Meat:
    
    If using wooden skewers, make sure to soak them in water for about 30 minutes before using. This prevents them from burning on the grill.
    Thread the marinated meat cubes onto the skewers, leaving a bit of space between each piece for even cooking.
    Grill the Shashlik:
    
    Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
    Place the skewers on the grill grates. Grill the shashlik for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking.
    Cooking times vary depending on the type of meat and how well-done you prefer it. Use a meat thermometer to check for desired doneness: 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare, 160°F (71°C) for medium, and 165°F (74°C) for well-done chicken.
    Serve:
    
    Once the shashlik is cooked to your liking, remove it from the grill.
    Serve the shashlik hot, either on or off the skewers.
    Shashlik is often accompanied by flatbreads, rice, or grilled vegetables.
    Optional Garnishes:
    
    You can sprinkle some fresh herbs (such as cilantro, parsley, or dill) over the cooked shashlik for added flavor and presentation.</pre></div>
