   <div><pre>Prepare the Char Siu Marinade:

    In a bowl, combine hoisin sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, honey or brown sugar, Chinese rice wine or sherry, five-spice powder, sesame oil, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Mix well to create the marinade.
    Marinate the Pork:
    
    Place the pork strips or chunks in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish.
    Pour the marinade over the pork, making sure all pieces are well coated.
    Seal the bag or cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight for maximum flavor. Occasionally turn or mix the pork to ensure even marination.
    Preheat the Oven or Grill:
    
    Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) or prepare a grill for indirect cooking.
    Cook the Char Siu:
    
    For Oven: Place the marinated pork on a baking rack set over a baking pan lined with aluminum foil for easy cleanup. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, basting with the marinade every 10 minutes.
    For Grill: If grilling, skewer the marinated pork pieces onto bamboo or metal skewers. Grill over indirect heat, turning and basting frequently until the pork is cooked through and has a nicely caramelized exterior.
    Glaze (Optional):
    
    About 10 minutes before the pork is done cooking, you can brush the honey or maltose over the pork to give it a shiny glaze. Be careful not to burn the glaze.
    Rest and Slice:
    
    Once the pork is cooked and has a nice color, remove it from the oven or grill and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.
    Serve:
    
    Slice the char siu into thin pieces and serve it as a main dish or as a flavorful addition to other dishes like rice, noodles, or sandwiches.</pre></div>
