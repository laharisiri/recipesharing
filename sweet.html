   <div><pre>Prepare the Pork:

    Season the pork pieces with salt and pepper.
    Coat the pork pieces in cornstarch, shaking off any excess.
    Heat oil in a deep pan or wok to about 350°F (175°C).
    Carefully add the coated pork pieces to the hot oil and fry until they are golden brown and crispy. This might be done in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Remove the cooked pork pieces and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
    Prepare the Sweet and Sour Sauce:
    
    In a bowl, mix together ketchup, rice vinegar, water, brown sugar, and soy sauce until well combined.
    If you prefer a thicker sauce, mix in a teaspoon of cornstarch into the sauce mixture until dissolved.
    Cook the Vegetables:
    
    In a separate pan or wok, heat a small amount of oil.
    Add the bell peppers and onions to the pan and stir-fry for a few minutes until they start to soften.
    Add the pineapple chunks and stir-fry for another minute.
    Combine and Serve:
    
    Add the crispy fried pork pieces to the pan with the vegetables.
    Pour the sweet and sour sauce over the pork and vegetables.
    Stir everything together gently until the sauce coats the pork and vegetables evenly.
    Continue cooking for a couple of minutes until the sauce thickens slightly and everything is heated through.
    Serve:
    
    Transfer the sweet and sour pork to a serving dish.
    Serve the dish over steamed rice or noodles.
    Optional Garnish:
    
    You can sprinkle some chopped green onions or sesame seeds on top for added flavor and presentation.</pre></div>
