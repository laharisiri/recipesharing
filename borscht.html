   <div><pre>Prepare the Vegetables:

    Peel and grate the beets, carrots, and onion. Dice the potato and mince the garlic.
    Sauté the Vegetables:
    
    In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion and garlic. Sauté for a few minutes until the onion becomes translucent.
    Add Beets and Tomato Paste:
    
    Add the grated beets and grated carrot to the pot. Stir well to combine with the sautéed onion and garlic.
    Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a few more minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
    Add Broth and Tomatoes:
    
    Pour in the vegetable or beef broth and add the diced tomatoes (along with their juice).
    Add the diced potato, shredded cabbage, bay leaf, and sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
    Simmer the Soup:
    
    Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let the soup simmer for about 20-30 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.
    Adjust Seasoning and Acidity:
    
    Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add more salt, pepper, or sugar to balance the flavors.
    Add the vinegar to give the soup a slight tanginess. Adjust the amount according to your taste preference.
    Serve:
    
    Remove the bay leaf from the soup.
    Ladle the borscht into bowls.
    Serve each bowl with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh dill on top..</pre></div>
